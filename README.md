# Web Worker API Performance Analysis
The documentation for the Web Worker APIs does not contain any clear information about performance, runtimes and workload for use.
No comprehensive tests could be found in a search that would allow a comparison of all relevant metrics.

**More information and an analysis of the test results can be found here: [Medium Post](https://medium.com/p/a89d9ed6f194)**

In this application, the same calculation is performed with and without Web Worker and test data is collected.

## Setup

Install dependencies

```sh
$ yarn install
